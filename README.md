# 📖 To Do List <a name="about-project"></a>

"To Do List" is a simple website that create a do List to check everyday task and remove what have been completed


<!-- > Describe your project in 1 or 2 sentences. -->
### How to build the "To Do List" 
- 1: Manage Daily task (plain JS with objects).
- 2: Shows list of tasks to be done (plain JS with classes) and add basic CSS.
- 3: Create a complete List of tasks to be done and update it.

**New Features add**
- CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods. All the elements of the user interface will be fully functional and your application will be completed.

-  Functionality to application to make it interactive.

Will start by building the core functionalities and ignoring how the website looks. At the very beginning the website will look similar to the UI below. Note that it is plain HTML with no styling, but it will allow to add and remove books from the list!

</p>

Once have the code working, will play with refactoring it. In this step will also need to adhere to the layout presented in the wireframe, but i will choose the application's styling. So i initial ugly HTML will turn into better with higher
functionality as described in the following video:
